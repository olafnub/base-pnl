# Base Onchain Summer Hackathon ‚Äº Ô∏èüòä

### Problem & Solution
We've realized there are no wallets or apps that show you your profits and losses on the coins that you buy. Except for centralized exchanges like Coinbase for example that show you but most wallets that you have connected to only show how much you're up/down for the day. So we've decided to create this! To show any user who connects with their wallet's PNL (profit n loss)
### Project Set up (dev)
[1. first make sure you have git, node, and nvm installed]\
-- Git/Github installation [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-setting-up-git)\
--Node/Nvm installation [https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js)

[2. then once everything is installed, git clone this project]\
-- watch youtube on how to git clone a repository if stuck

[3. once you're in the project terminal, run "npm i" to install all node packages]

### If the project is already cloned onto your desktop
[1. Then just run "git pull"]

### Notes
You will not have a .env file in your project because if you look at the .gitignore file, you'll see that .env is in there, meaning .env files from local machine will not be pushed to the github. This is necessary because you don't want to expose your API keys in the .env file. Msg me for the api key or create your own and replace the BASE_API=YOUR_API_KEY. I'll also have a .env.example file to reference off of

### TIps
- To run your index.js file, type "node index.js" (make sure you're in the right directory). 
- Console.log("hello world") is your best friend
